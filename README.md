# To-do list courses

It's a mini application to manage courses (CRUD), I created it using just native javascript.
The user can create a new course by clicking on the button **Add course** or **the enter's key**. 
If the input is empty an alert will be shown to indicate that the input is required.
The user can also consult the list of the created courses.
Finally the user can delete a specific course by clicking on it with the cursor.


## Features

- Create new course (By clicking on the button "Add course" or the  enter's key)
- Delete course
